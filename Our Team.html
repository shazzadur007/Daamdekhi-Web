	<h3>Our Team</h3>
	<p>Each and every one of our groups represent the spirit of our company: driven, committed, and acutely aware of how limitless daamDekhiâ€™s potential is to grow. We go to great lengths to identify self-starters with different experience and skill sets to produce not just an effective workforce, but a well-rounded, talented and complementary team.
	<br>
	<br>
	We have a passion for our clients' true results and a pragmatic drive for action that starts every morning 9 am and doesn't let up. We rally clients with our infectious energy, to make change stick.
	<br>
	<br>
	And we never go it alone. We support and are supported to develop our own personal results stories. We balance challenging and co-creating with our clients, building the internal capabilities required for them to create repeatable results.
	<br>
	<br>
	We work hard, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. We enjoy what we do and we laugh a lot...most often at ourselves. It feels different to work with us.
